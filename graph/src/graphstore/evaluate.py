"""Conjecture evaluation loop (Epic Q): close discover -> predict -> EVALUATE.

Epic P generated analogical conjectures; this stage judges them. The judgment is done by an
**in-session Claude Code sub-agent** acting as a skeptical ML-theory expert (no API call — the
project methodology requires NLP/judgment steps to use in-session sub-agents), and the result
is committed as ``graph/evaluations/conjecture_evaluations.json``.

This module is the **deterministic gate** over that artifact — the same discipline the
``grounding`` package applies to sub-agent prose. It does NOT call a model. It checks that:

  1. the artifact is well-formed (every entry has a verdict in the allowed set, non-empty
     reasoning, and a named related-work anchor); and
  2. every evaluated conjecture is **grounded in the system's real output** — its
     ``projection`` is a conjecture the ``transfer`` pipeline actually generates for the named
     analogy. So an evaluation can never drift from, or be invented independently of, the
     conjectures the system really produced.

The payoff is the closed loop: the analogy ``banach ~~ weighted_conformal`` produced the
conjecture "conformal prediction has a fixed point", and an independent judge found it
**plausible** — recovering full conformal prediction's self-consistency — while rejecting a
capacity-control conjecture as **implausible** (conformal coverage is distribution-free). The
system invents hypotheses *and* tells the good ones from the bad.
