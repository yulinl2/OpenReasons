# OpenPriors — Roadmap & development governance

> *Open-source your ideas, not just your code.* This file is the project's planning and
> governance layer: the task hierarchy, the branch/iteration strategy, the supervision
> mechanism, and the backup/redundancy policy. It exists so the work can run
> autonomously without losing auditability or safety.

## 1. The north star

A package that **formally represents the concepts and reasoning chains of a text** as an
`(object, attribute, relation)` node/edge graph — the substrate a structure-mapping
novelty detector operates on (see `Imports/structure mapping notes.md`). Everything below
is an increment toward that, each shippable and independently verified.

## 2. Task hierarchy (epics → iterations → steps)

```
EPIC A · Faithful structural floor   ── decomposer/         [SHIPPED, merged #1]
  raw document -> clean nested structure (tree + node/edge graph)
  steps: extract-principles · ingest · normalize · classify · hierarchical-split · verify

EPIC B · Concept & reasoning graph   ── concept_graph/      [IN PROGRESS, iteration 2]
  decomposer nodes/edges -> (object, attribute, relation) concepts + reasoning DAG
  steps: lift structural relations · derive semantic relations (proves/defines/derives)
         · reasoning-chain DAG · verify (conservation, traceability, acyclicity)
  frontier (sub-agent driven): fine-grained OAR extraction inside theorems/equations

EPIC D · Prose front end                ── grounding/        [iteration 5]
  sub-agent lifts prose -> predicate-calculus dgroups, gated by a deterministic
  grounding check, then solved by the analogy engine (the loop runs on raw text)

EPIC C · Structure-mapping matcher    ── matcher/ (MAC) + analogy/ (FAC)
  content-vectors over relation tuples (MAC, renaming-invariant) + SME-style
  alignment (FAC) + candidate-inference / shortcut detector (the novelty signal)

EPIC E · Generalization (breadth+depth) ── retrieval/ + analogy/ (deeper)
  E library-scale MAC/FAC retrieval (nearest known prior) · F full-proof multi-prior
  set-cover decomposition (reused theorems + novel residual) · G deeper SME engine
  (minimal ascension for near-synonyms + skolem-penalized inferences)
```

Each epic is a top-level package; each iteration is one branch + one PR; each step keeps
the **Argue / Build / Verify** triad and is recorded under `<pkg>/runs/` or `<pkg>/graphs/`.

## 3. Branch & iteration strategy

- `main` — always green, always the integration point. Protected by CI (`.github/workflows`).
- `claude/openpriors-<topic>-<session>` — one feature branch per iteration. Squash-merged
  into `main` only when **CI is green and review is addressed**. Merged branches are the
  redundant on-`main` record; the branch itself is a backup until deleted.
- **Nesting/stacking:** an iteration that depends on unmerged work stacks on its parent
  branch; otherwise it branches from fresh `main`. Prefer branching from `main` (epics are
  decoupled by the on-disk JSONL contract, not by Python imports).
- **Pace/checkpointing:** commit at every working increment (a passing test + a runnable
  pipeline), never a half-built state; push frequently so the remote is the live backup.

## 4. Supervision (the monitoring mechanism)

- **CI = the always-on supervisor.** `.github/workflows/decomposer-ci.yml` (and a sibling
  for `concept_graph/`) run the test suite + the full pipeline (which itself gates on the
  build-independent invariants) on every push/PR. A red gate blocks merge.
- **Independent verification is library code**, unit-tested to *fail* on broken input
  ("verify the verifier"), so the gate cannot silently rot into a no-op.
- **Code review:** automated reviewer (Copilot) on each PR; findings are triaged and fixed
  or rebutted with reasons.

## 5. Backup & redundancy policy

- **Source of truth is git on the remote** (this container is ephemeral — anything not
  pushed is lost). Push after every iteration; never leave unpushed work overnight.
- **Three redundant representations** of every decomposition guard against single-format
  loss: nested `document.json` (tree) + `nodes.jsonl` + `edges.jsonl` (graph). The concept
  graph adds `concepts.jsonl` + `relations.jsonl`.
- **Provenance + content hashes** on every artifact (`meta.json`) make any output
  reconstructable and tamper-evident.
- **Pinned dependencies** (`requirements.txt`) + emitted JSON Schema make runs reproducible
  and externally auditable.

## 6. Decision log & honesty

- Architecture decisions live in `<pkg>/docs/decisions/*` (ADRs) with the
  performance-vs-resource argument; the development trajectory lives in
  `<pkg>/docs/development-log.md`; open issues are tracked there explicitly rather than
  hidden. A claim of "done & verified" is only made when CI is green and the invariants pass.

## 7. Status

| Epic | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A · decomposer | ✅ merged (#1), CI green | 4 corpora pass all invariants; 0.85 differential recall |
| B · concept_graph | ✅ merged (#2), CI green | OAR lift + 17-edge reasoning DAG + SME bridge; all corpora verified |
| C · matcher (MAC) | ✅ merged (#3), CI green | MAC content-vector retrieval + **renaming-invariance holds for all graphs** + systematicity |
| C · analogy (FAC) | ✅ merged (#4), CI green | SME structural alignment + candidate-inference **novelty/shortcut detector**; recovers the textbook solar→atom mapping |
| D · grounding (prose front end) | ✅ merged (#6) | sub-agent prose→dgroup + **deterministic grounding gate**; solves the 4 riddles; Banach case (#8) + discrimination (#9) validate on real math |
| E · retrieval (MAC/FAC) | ✅ merged (#11) | **library-scale** novelty retrieval: MAC content-vector filter → SME/FAC rerank → nearest known prior + graded reuse/novelty |
| F · proof decomposition | ✅ merged (#12) | **multi-prior set-cover**: explain a full proof as composed theorems + isolate the novel residual (MDL framing) |
| G · deeper SME engine | ✅ merged (#13) | **minimal ascension** (near-synonym predicates align) + **skolem-penalized** inferences; both opt-in |
| H · HTML-native ingestion | ✅ merged (#15) | third decomposer path (ar5iv HTML) + **cross-path differential** verification (34/34 sections) |
| I · trickle-down systematicity | ✅ merged (#16) | reward deep relational webs: candidate-inference score gains with supporting sub-structure depth |
| J · ANN index for MAC | ✅ merged (#17) | pure-Python **SimHash LSH**; true nearest at **<1%** of the library exact-scored |
| K · real paper end-to-end | ✅ merged (#18) | **arXiv 2006.06138** (Lei & Candès): MAC→FAC→set-cover reads the paper as *weighted conformal + {COUNTERFACTUAL, NESTED}* — its actual contribution, isolated automatically |
| L · reasoning lineage | ✅ merged (#19) | **multi-result *extends* DAG** from grounded structure: recovers split → weighted → counterfactual conformal (novelty 0.71 → 0.22) with no citation metadata; objects = results, relation = extends, attributes = residual |
| M · unified graph store | ✅ merged (#20) | **the end-goal package**: one typed (object, attribute, relation) graph — entity/fact/functor/result nodes, **reified facts** (n-ary + nested CAUSE lossless), JSONL persistence; the project's questions become graph traversals |
| N · cross-domain analogy | ✅ merged (#21) | the SME mechanism **across two literatures**: a declared role ascension lets `CAUSE(premise→guarantee)` align across domains, surfacing *weighted-conformal ~~ Banach-contraction* (`cal_test↔the_map`, `interval↔iterate-seq`); `analogous_to` edges in the same graph; lineage shown domain-agnostic. (Also: fixed an aligner determinism bug — non-bijective MHs now rejected.) |
| O · unsupervised roles | ✅ merged (#22) | the role ascension is **discovered**, not declared: each functor's role is read from its position in the `CAUSE` glue (premise/conclusion/arity). Over **three** literatures (+ learning theory) the *structural-property* role is found identical across all, yielding *weighted-conformal ~~ Banach ~~ VC-generalization* with **zero hand-coded knowledge**; deeper causal chains score higher |
| P · analogical transfer | ✅ merged (#23) | **using** an analogy, not just finding it: SME **candidate inferences** project the base's unmatched structure onto the target as conjectures — *"by analogy with Banach, the conformal calibration procedure has a fixed point"* (invented `skolem` object), tagged novel/confirmed, attached as `conjectures` edges. Analogy as a hypothesis generator |
| Q · conjecture evaluation | ✅ merged (#24) | **closes discover→predict→evaluate**: an in-session Claude Code sub-agent judges each conjecture (no API call); a **deterministic gate** validates the committed judgment + grounds every verdict to a real transfer conjecture. The fixed-point conjecture is judged **plausible** (recovers conformal self-consistency); a capacity conjecture **implausible** (conformal is distribution-free). Gate unit-tested to fail on tampering |
| R · capstone pipeline | ✅ merged (#25) | **the whole thesis as one command**: ingest→lineage→unify→discover analogies→transfer→evaluate over three literatures, one summary + one unified graph (197 nodes incl. results/facts/functors/entities/conjectures, 367 edges, verdicts on nodes). End-to-end invariants gated in CI |
| S · query DSL | ✅ merged (#26) | the graph is **interrogable**: `shortest_path` (crosses lineage into analogy, linking literatures), `shared_ancestor`, `explain_analogy` (the SME correspondence), `conjectures_with_verdicts`, `find`. A single query runs from a conformal theorem through the analogy web into a learning-theory result |
| T · top-level legibility | ✅ merged (#27) | root **README + Makefile** present the full A→S story as one system; `make setup && make pipeline && make query && make test` — the repo reads top-to-bottom and the capstone runs in one command |
| U · fourth literature | ✅ merged (#28) | **martingale concentration** (McDiarmid/Bernstein) joins the analogy web with **zero new design**: its `BOUNDED_MARTINGALE` is auto-discovered as the same `PC/2` structural-property role → the **4-way** analogy *…:: bounded-martingale : concentration*. Pipeline now 4 literatures / 278 nodes / 24 analogies; lineage `bernstein → mcdiarmid` |
| V · second real paper | ✅ merged (#29) | **Nesterov's accelerated gradient** (sub-agent-lifted) end-to-end in optimization, like K in conformal: set-cover reads the *estimate-sequence* as borrowed and isolates **`OPTIMAL_RATE`** as the contribution; its momentum step is discovered at the same `PC/2` role so the paper joins the cross-domain web (*Nesterov : acceleration :: contraction : convergence*) |
| W · per-result novelty | ✅ merged (#30) | the novelty-detector thesis at graph scale: every result node gets a precise **novelty = 1 − best-prior coverage** (the prior must be no larger, so a descendant can't cover its ancestor); scores match the validated lineage/papers exactly (paper 0.22, base results 1.0). `dsl.novelty_of` / `most_novel` |
| X · formal graph schema | ✅ merged (#31) | the end-goal artifact made **rigorous**: emitted draft-2020-12 **JSON Schema** + a dependency-free validator enforcing kinds/required-attrs/relations **plus referential integrity + arg-edge contiguity**; the capstone graph validates in CI; validator unit-tested to fail on each violation |
| Y · discovery loop | ✅ merged (#32) | **evaluate → investigate**: the *uncertain*-judged conjectures refined by an in-session sub-agent into precise, citation-grounded **research directions** (sharpened statement / what's established / open question / next step), gated to anchor on real open conjectures. The "ERM operator fixed point" conjecture becomes a *fixed-point uniform-convergence* program (Balakrishnan–Wainwright–Yu) |
| Z · run the experiment | ✅ merged (#33) | **investigate → experiment**: the system runs research direction C2's own proposed test — pure-Python finite-MDP numerics confirming the L2(mu) contraction modulus = `gamma` at `mu=d` (Bertsekas–Tsitsiklis) and rising **monotonically with `chi^2(d‖mu)`** until contraction breaks. A proposed direction backed by actual computation; loop now discover→predict→evaluate→investigate→experiment |
| AA · second experiment (C4) | ✅ this PR | **investigate → experiment, again**: the system runs research direction C4's proposed test — the **fixed-point-uniform-convergence** theorem on the canonical Balakrishnan–Wainwright–Yu symmetric 2-Gaussian-mixture **EM operator** `M(θ)=E[X·tanh(Xθ/σ²)]`. Pure-Python numerics confirm `M(θ*)=θ*`, a local contraction modulus `κ<1`, and the Banach perturbation bound `‖θ̂ₙ−θ*‖ ≤ εₙ/(1−κ)` holding for **all 150 samples** (tight, non-vacuous) with the empirical fixed-point error decaying at the `1/√n` uniform-convergence rate — recovering the BWY guarantee from an operator-class uniform-convergence argument. A second proposed direction backed by computation; gate unit-tested to fail on a violated bound |
| AB · audit report | ✅ this PR | the **prose front door**: a single `REPORT.md` generated **live** from the pipeline (`make report`) — literatures, lineage, the analogy web, discovered roles, conjectures + verdicts, research directions, and both C2/C4 experiment tables, every figure computed from the same code paths `make pipeline` runs. `report/build_report.py` + `report/test_report.py`; report-ci rebuilds + git-diff-gates it in sync (can't silently rot), the auditable counterpart to the visual dashboard |
| AI · third real paper (the prediction, realized) | ✅ this PR | **the loop closes against reality**: the system *predicted* (conjecture C6, judged plausible) that "weighted conformal calibration is a no-regret play"; this ingests the real paper that instantiates it — **Gibbs & Candès (2021), Adaptive Conformal Inference Under Distribution Shift**. Lifted into a grounded dgroup and decomposed, it is a genuine **cross-field synthesis**: covered by priors from **both** online learning (`online_no_regret`) and conformal prediction (`conformal_prediction_set`) — unlike Nesterov (all-optimization) or the counterfactual paper (all-conformal) — with the novel residual being the ACI online α-update rule and the `NO_REGRET → COVERAGE` bridge (+ its distribution-shift robustness) that C6 predicted — the guarantee being long-run (time-averaged empirical) coverage, not per-step marginal coverage. Its no-regret play is discovered at the shared `PC/2` role, so the paper sits at the **analogy junction**, analogous to both `online_gradient_descent` (score 12) and `weighted_conformal` (score 9). `realpaper3.py` + `aci_paper.json` + `aci_priors.json`; gated in graph-ci |
| AH · fourth experiment (C7) | ✅ prior PR | **every committed research direction is now computed** (C2, C4, C5, C7). C7's own proposed test: quadratics `f_t(x)=½(x−c_t)ᵀdiag(1,κ)(x−c_t)` across three regimes. Confirmed: the informed step `η=1/L` contracts geometrically at **exactly `1−1/κ`** (machine-eps by T) while the regret-optimal schedule `η_t=min(1/L,1/μt)` — which earns **stable regret/log T** — decays only **polynomially (exponent −1)**: a super-geometric **price of robustness** that grows with conditioning and *vanishes at κ=1*; under drift the informed iterate tracks at **exactly `δ(κ−1)`** (the contraction-plus-drift law). The parameter-free both-poles algorithm + lower bound remain C7's open frontier, not gated. Fully deterministic (no RNG); gate unit-tested to fail on tampering |
| AG · third experiment (C5) | ✅ prior PR | **the loop's first fully self-generated experiment**: direction C5 (born from the fifth literature's conjecture, judged *uncertain*, refined *promising* — all this session) proposed its own numerical test, and the system ran it. Pure-Python OGD on two-player quadratic games `F(z)=(μI+γS)z+b`: the **empirical per-step rate equals the closed-form spectral radius in every phase cell** (the OGD map is a scaled rotation), the judge's Banach condition `η<2μ/L²` is proven **identical** to `ρ<1` (modulus = spectral radius, gap <1e-12), the bilinear pole diverges at `√(1+η²γ²)` with quadratically-vanishing excess (continuous-time recurrence), and **averaged play stays bounded while the last iterate wanders** — the C5 dichotomy observed directly. Gate unit-tested to fail on tampered cells |
| AF · evaluate field 5 | ✅ prior PR | the **discover→predict→evaluate→investigate loop closed over the fifth literature**: the online-learning conjectures judged by the in-session sub-agent (C5 fixed-point-of-no-regret-play *uncertain*, C7 curvature→no-regret *uncertain*, and the headline **C6 "conformal calibration is a no-regret play" judged *plausible*** — the system re-derived the Gibbs–Candès adaptive-conformal-inference bridge by analogy); the two uncertain ones refined into gated research directions (C5 *promising*: the last-iterate convergence/recurrence phase boundary; C7 *narrow*: the price-of-robustness question). Evaluation gate now loads every corpus from `multidomain.CORPORA` so it stays in lockstep with the pipeline |
| AE · analogy-web discrimination | ✅ prior PR | the **negative control** for the five-way web: a structurally-broken twin of the online-learning field with *identical vocabulary* but the `CAUSE(premise→pivot→guarantee)` spine removed loses its `PC/2` pivot role and **all** its cross-domain analogies (score collapses 7.0 → 0), while the intact field bridges strongly. Proves the analogy is driven by causal *structure*, not shared functor names — the web discriminates, it isn't promiscuous (positive-vs-negative control, like the grounding riddles) |
| AD · reproducibility + grounding coverage | ✅ prior PR | **solidify**: two whole-pipeline gates. (1) *Grounding coverage* — every result that can enter the unified graph (every corpus in `multidomain.CORPORA` + the real arXiv paper) must pass `grounding.verify`, so no ungrounded/hallucinated-symbol result can be ingested and any future literature is auto-checked. (2) *Determinism* — the unsupervised analogy discovery is run in two separate processes with different `PYTHONHASHSEED`; the discovered roles and analogy pair-set must be identical, so the Epic-N nondeterminism bug class can't silently return. Both gates unit-tested to fail on tampered input |
| AC · fifth literature (online learning) | ✅ prior PR | **online learning / regret minimization** (Zinkevich OGD; Hazan–Agarwal–Kale strong-convexity) joins the analogy web with **zero new design**, like Epic U — its `NO_REGRET` "no-regret play" is auto-discovered as the same `PC/2` structural-property role → the **5-way** analogy *…:: no-regret play : sublinear regret*. Pipeline now 5 literatures / 12 results / **40 analogies**; lineage `online_strong_convexity → online_gradient_descent`. Only data + registration changed; the engine is untouched |
| 🎈 interactive demo | ✅ prior PR | the **public front door**: a single self-contained `docs/index.html` (GitHub Pages) with four zoom levels — Story → Map → Discoveries → Under-the-Hood — built live from the pipeline output (`make demo`), so it never drifts. `demo/model.py` + `demo/build_demo.py`; demo-ci gates it in sync + self-contained |
