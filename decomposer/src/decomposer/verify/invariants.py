"""Reusable, build-independent invariant checkers (独立检验 as library code).

Each check is a machine-checkable predicate derived from a principle (P1-P4 in
``docs/principles.md``). They share no code with the extractors, so a bug in an
extractor does not silently pass its own check. ``check_idempotent`` and the
differential check live closest to the build; ``check_character_coverage`` and
``check_reference_integrity`` are pure accounting over the *output* and are the
strongest independent oracles.
