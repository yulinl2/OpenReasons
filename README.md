> *Open-source your ideas, not just your code.*

OpenPriors reads scientific results, represents their **reasoning** as an (object, attribute,
relation) graph, and uses **structure mapping** — relational structure, not surface wording
("isomorphism under renaming, not lexical overlap"; `Imports/structure mapping notes.md`) — to
do the things a researcher does with ideas: judge what's **novel**, trace how results **build
on** each other, find **analogies across fields**, **conjecture** what an analogy predicts, and
**evaluate** those conjectures. It starts as a novelty detector and ends as a closed
*discover → predict → evaluate* loop, grounded end to end — every symbol traceable to a
verbatim span of its source.

Built under one doctrine — **论证 / 构建 / 独立检验** (Argue / Build / Independently-Verify) —
with deterministic code wherever an invariant is machine-checkable, and in-session sub-agents
(no API cost) only where natural-language understanding is irreducible. Every claim is gated by
CI; every gate is unit-tested to fail on broken input.

## 🎈 See it, don't read it

**[▶ Open the interactive dashboard](https://demo.open-priors.org/)** — a single
self-contained page ([`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html)) with **four zoom levels**, from a
10-year-old's story to the raw audit graph:

| 🎈 Story | 🗺️ The Map | 💡 Discoveries | 🔧 Under the Hood |
|---|---|---|---|
| what it does, in emoji | the 4 fields + the analogy web | the guesses, verdicts, experiment | the graph, a fact unpacked, the schema |

It reads live from the pipeline's own output (`make demo` rebuilds it), so it never drifts from
what the system actually found. *(If the Pages link isn't live yet, open `docs/index.html`
directly — it needs no server and no network.)*

Prefer prose? **[📄 Read the audit report](REPORT.md)** — a consolidated, technical write-up of
every literature, lineage, analogy, discovered role, conjecture, research direction, and all
four numerical experiments, with **every figure computed live** from the pipeline (`make report`
rebuilds it; CI fails if it's stale).

## The pipeline

```
 raw document ─▶ decompose ─▶ ground ─▶ retrieve/novelty ─▶ lineage
   (A)            (A·B·C)       (D)         (E·F·K)           (L)
                                                                │
            ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ▼
   unified (object, attribute, relation) graph ─▶ cross-domain analogy ─▶ conjecture ─▶ evaluate ─▶ query
              (M)                                    (N·O)                    (P)          (Q)        (S)
                                          └────────── one command: make pipeline (R) ──────────┘
```

**Front end (A–C)** turns raw text into structure; **middle (D–L)** turns structure into a
grounded novelty/lineage signal; **graph layer (M–S)** unifies it all into one queryable graph
that discovers analogies *across literatures*, predicts, and self-evaluates.

| Epic | Dir | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | [`decomposer/`](decomposer) | First-principles document decomposition: raw LaTeX/HTML/Markdown → clean **nested hierarchical** tree + node/edge graph (de-redundancy, data-class classification, cross-ref resolution). Verified by char-coverage conservation, schema, reference integrity, idempotence, **differential oracle vs LaTeXML HTML (0.85 recall)**. |
| **B** | [`concept_graph/`](concept_graph) | Lifts structure into the **(object, attribute, relation)** representation + a reasoning DAG + SME bridge. |
| **C** | [`matcher/`](matcher), [`analogy/`](analogy) | MAC content-vector retrieval + linchpin **renaming-invariance**; SME structural alignment + candidate-inference **novelty detector** (recovers the textbook solar→atom mapping). |
| **D** | [`grounding/`](grounding) | Prose→dgroup **grounding gate** (every symbol a verbatim source substring); solves 4 riddles; Banach/discrimination cases on real math. |
| **E–G** | [`retrieval/`](retrieval), `analogy/` | Library-scale **MAC/FAC** nearest-prior retrieval; full-proof **set-cover** decomposition (novel residual); deeper SME (minimal ascension, skolem penalty). |
| **H–J** | `decomposer/`, `analogy/`, `retrieval/` | HTML-native ingestion + cross-path differential; trickle-down systematicity; **SimHash-LSH ANN** for MAC at scale (<1% examined). |
| **K–L** | `retrieval/`, `grounding/` | Real paper end-to-end (**arXiv 2006.06138** → residual COUNTERFACTUAL+NESTED); multi-result **reasoning lineage** DAG. |
| **M** | [`graph/`](graph) | The end-goal package: one unified graph — entity/fact/functor/result nodes, **reified facts** (n-ary + nested CAUSE, lossless), JSONL persistence; questions become traversals. |
| **N–O** | `graph/` | **Cross-domain analogy** edges (a second literature); the role ascension is **discovered unsupervised** from CAUSE structure across a third literature → *weighted-conformal ~~ Banach ~~ VC-generalization*. |
| **P–Q** | `graph/` | **Analogical conjecture transfer** ("the conformal procedure has a fixed point"); an in-session sub-agent **judges** each conjecture, gated deterministically. |
| **R–S** | `graph/` | **Capstone driver** (the whole chain as one command + one graph) and a **query DSL** (path / shared-ancestor / explain-analogy / conjecture lookup). |
| **U** | `graph/` | A **fourth literature** (martingale concentration) joins the analogy web with **no new design** — its bounded-difference martingale is auto-discovered to play the same structural-property role → *…:: bounded-martingale : concentration*. |
| **AC** | `graph/` | A **fifth literature** (online learning / regret) joins the same way — its **no-regret play** is auto-discovered at the identical `PC/2` structural-property role → *…:: no-regret play : sublinear regret*. Five fields, one mechanism, zero engine changes. |
| **AI** | `graph/` | A **third real paper the system *predicted***: conjecture C6 (plausible) said "conformal calibration is a no-regret play"; **Gibbs–Candès Adaptive Conformal Inference** is that paper. It decomposes as a **cross-field synthesis** (online + conformal priors), its novel residual is the online α-update rule and the predicted `NO_REGRET→COVERAGE` bridge, and it sits at the analogy junction of both fields. Prediction validated against the real literature. |

## Run the whole thing

```bash
make setup        # one venv, pinned deps
make pipeline     # the capstone: ingest 5 literatures -> analogies -> conjectures -> verdicts
make query        # interrogate the unified graph
make test         # all 240 tests across every epic
```

The front-end stages (decompose → ground) run via `make run`; each package's README has its
own runnable demos and `PYTHONPATH` one-liners.

## How it's built (governance)

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md): epic → iteration → step hierarchy, branch strategy, CI as
the supervision gate (10 workflows), and the backup/redundancy policy (push-after-iteration;
triple JSON/JSONL representations; provenance + content hashes; pinned deps + emitted JSON
Schema; reproducible outputs via `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`). Each epic's `docs/` holds its
lit-review (sub-agent produced), ADRs, and development log.

## Validation

The pipeline is exercised end-to-end on raw text, and the novelty signal is validated with
positive **and** negative controls that together span the lexical < structural distinction:

| Demonstration | What it shows | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Riddles** (`grounding.cli`) | *identical surface, different structure* → different answer | riddles 1&2 → "1 hour" (`DIVIDES`); 3&4 → "3 hours" (`EQUALS`) |
| **Banach case** (`grounding.casestudy`) | *different surface, same structure* → an instance | problem_07 Q1 vs Banach: novelty **0.09**, "INSTANCE — known machinery, relabeled"; isolates `ITERATION_COMPLEXITY` as the lone novel fact |
| **Discrimination** (`grounding.discrimination`) | the detector is *not vacuous* | Banach vs Q1 = 0.09 (instance) **vs** Banach vs Q2 = 1.00 (distinct theorem); margin **0.91** |

So a result whose structure is a renamed copy of a known theorem scores ~0 novelty, while a
genuinely different theorem scores ~1 — exactly the "shortcut under fancy disguise" signal
from `Imports/structure mapping notes.md` §6, validated on real mathematics.

## Generalization (breadth & depth)

On top of the validated core, the detector generalizes from pairwise comparison to
library- and proof-scale, and the engine itself is deepened:

| Stage | What it adds | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **retrieval / MAC·FAC** (`retrieval.cli`) | *breadth*: retrieve the **nearest known prior** from a theorem library (cheap content-vector MAC filter → SME/FAC rerank) | Q1 → INSTANCE of Banach (0.09); Q2 → largely-novel extension of the CLT skeleton (0.70); distractor never selected |
| **proof decomposition** (`retrieval.decompose`) | *depth*: explain a **full proof as a composition** of known theorems (greedy set-cover, MDL) | Q1 proof = Banach + strong-convexity + Kantorovich–Rubinstein, with the ε-sensitivity assumption + iteration bound as the **novel residual** |
| **deeper SME** (`analogy.align`) | *depth*: **minimal ascension** (near-synonym predicates align via a type lattice) + **skolem-penalized** inferences (opt-in) | `MINIMIZE`≈`OPTIMIZE` now align; defaults unchanged |

**240 tests · 10 CI workflows · all green · reproducible · $0 marginal API cost.**

## The closed loop (graph layer)

The graph layer (M–U) is where the project's thesis lands: one unified graph over **four
literatures** (conformal prediction, optimization, learning theory, martingale concentration)
that the system reasons over end to end. `make pipeline` prints it in one pass:

| Stage | What it does | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **unify** (`graphstore.pipeline`) | one (object, attribute, relation) graph, reified facts | 278 nodes, 512 edges, every fact losslessly reconstructable |
| **lineage** | recover each field's development line | `split → weighted → counterfactual` conformal; analogous chains in optimization, learning & concentration |
| **analogy** (`crossdomain`, `multidomain`) | discover cross-domain analogies, **roles read from CAUSE structure, unsupervised** | *weighted-exchangeability : coverage :: contraction : convergence :: uniform-convergence : generalization :: bounded-martingale : concentration* — zero hand-coded knowledge, a 4th field joins with no new design |
| **transfer** (`transfer`) | project candidate inferences as conjectures | *"by analogy with Banach, the conformal procedure has a **fixed point**"* (an invented object) |
| **evaluate** (`evaluate`) | an in-session sub-agent judges each conjecture; a deterministic gate validates + grounds the verdict | fixed-point conjecture **plausible** (recovers conformal self-consistency); a capacity conjecture **implausible** (conformal is distribution-free) |
| **investigate** (`discover`) | refine the *uncertain*-judged conjectures into precise, citation-grounded research directions | the "ERM operator fixed point" conjecture becomes a *fixed-point uniform-convergence* program (C4) |
| **experiment** (`experiment_c2/c4/c5/c7`) | **run** every direction's own numerical test, pure-Python | C2: the L2(μ) contraction modulus is governed by `χ²(d‖μ)`; **C4**: the Banach bound `‖θ̂ₙ−θ*‖ ≤ εₙ/(1−κ)` holds for all samples on the BWY Gaussian-mixture EM operator, at the `1/√n` rate; **C5**: on two-player quadratic games, vanilla OGD's empirical rate **equals the spectral radius** in every phase cell — convergence iff `η<2μ/L²`, averaged play converges while the last iterate wanders; **C7**: the informed step contracts at exactly `1−1/κ` while the regret-optimal schedule decays at exponent −1 — a **price of robustness** that grows with conditioning |
| **query** (`dsl`) | interrogate the graph | one path runs from a conformal theorem through the analogy web into a learning-theory result |

So the system doesn't just detect novelty — it **situates a result among its priors, finds
what it's structurally analogous to in another field, predicts what that analogy implies, tells
the sound predictions from the spurious, refines the open ones into research directions, and
runs their proposed experiments** — the full *discover → predict → evaluate → investigate →
experiment* loop, with every step grounded and CI-gated.

## Frontier

The discover → predict → evaluate loop is complete and queryable. Remaining work is **scale and
breadth** — more literatures and a second real paper end-to-end (the unsupervised role
discovery and analogy machinery already generalize with no new design), richer ingestion (PDF),
and feeding high-value novel conjectures back to a sub-agent for literature search — each
plugging into the existing grounded-graph path.
