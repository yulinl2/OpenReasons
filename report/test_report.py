"""The consolidated research report stays in sync with the live system.

These gate that `REPORT.md` is exactly what `report/build_report.build_markdown()` produces from the
live pipeline (so it can't silently rot), and that it is actually populated with the real counts,
every literature, and both numerical experiments.
