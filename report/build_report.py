"""Generate `REPORT.md` — the consolidated, auditable research report, live from the pipeline.

Where the interactive demo (`demo/`) is the *visual* front door, this is the *prose* one: a single
Markdown document a technical reader can audit top-to-bottom, with **every number computed from the
same code paths the pipeline uses** (via `demo.model.build_model`) plus both research-direction
experiments (C2, C4). So the report can never drift from what OpenPriors actually produces — a
CI gate rebuilds it and fails on any diff (`report/test_report.py` + `report-ci`).
